A Simple Function to Produce Balance Table for multiple treatment groups, should be useful for social science experiments.

Motivation of this repo: there just isn't simply a good off the shelf solution for generating balance table that is not 'treatment v.s control' in stata/python, and I do need one of these for reasons that many social science experiments have more than one treatment group (for the sake of testing heterogeneity or just because of the feature of the experiment design). These kind of tables often fails to make the final paper, however, I found them useful analysing the results.

So, I took what I have written in one of my own project and put it in public sphere. The code is not quite up to the task of handling every type of 'making balance tables' and lacks crucial documentation. I would like to make inprovement to the code and amand the documentation when I found myself some free time and not feeling burnout. Mean while, I hope you found this little code snippet helpful in your project/exploration with data.
